# CE889 Group Project

### _Deadline: 2024-12-09_

## Project Description
- Group of 4 people
- detail of [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales): Rossmann Store Sales
- Design and implement a Deep Learning architecture to solve the Kaggle challenge.
- Submit your results to the Kaggle website to get a score from the competition site.
- Presentation of your results and architecture explaining how the network works and what kind of 
tuning you did for the hyperparameters.

## Project objectives
-  **Pre-processing of data**
    - Understand how to load CSV files with training & testing data.
    - Understand how to handle categorical values when using NN.
    - Understand how to handle dates.
    - Capable of handling missing data.

- **Deep Learning Implementation**
  - Capable of implementing a deep learning architecture using TensorFlow or Pytorch.
  - Understand how different deep learning architectures work

- **Comparison of architectures**
  -  At least 1 Deep Learning architecture, MLP (with 1 or multiple) layers is not allowed.
  - Show evidence of optimisation process of hyperparameters and not only simple implementation.
  - Show a table with the different results.

- **Competition**
  - The group that builds the deep learning architecture with the best performance metric in the Kaggle website wins.
  - A score from the Kaggle website is needed. 

## Presentation

A title slide with your team number and the names of your team members

- **1-4 Slides on Pre-processing**
  - What data did you use and why
  - How did you process this data
  - Was there any data you didnâ€™t use and why
- **1-3 slides on the type of Deep NN**
  - Why, did you use that one
  - Topology/Architecture
- **1 Slide on the score that you achieved**
  - When you submitted you results on the Kaggle website what rank / score did you achieve (with screen Shots)
- **1 Slide on what each team member contributed to the task**
